### 1.2.1&1.2.2
- **sum rule** and **product rule**
- **Bayesian Formula**
- **Expectations and covariances**

### 1.2.3&1.2.4
- **Bayesian Prospective** : describe uncertainty in model parameters
- right-hand side of Bayes's theorem, *p(D|w)* is called the **likelihood function**
- Bayes's thorem : *posterior <- likelihood x prior*
- frequentists and bayesians differ on the likelihood function
    - frequentists : maximum likelihood, bootstrap
    - problems of bayesians : prior distribution is often selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rathen than reflections of prior beliefs
- **Mode** : maximum of a dstribution, for a Gaussian distribution, the mode coincides with the mean
- **i.i.d.** : independent and identically distributed(data points that are drawn independently from the same distribution)
- **Likelihood function of Gaussian distribution** : p(x | μ,σ2) = products of N(x | μ,σ2) from one to N
- Maximum likelihood approach underestimates the variance of the distribution(bias) -> over-fitting
